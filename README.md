# job_search_tracker
Meant to go through my account in job searching websites and update a given spreadsheet with applied jobs and their status

## TODOS & Roadmap
1. Read from html files of websites (look into possible apis  for certain sites)
2. parse through them to find relevant info and store it
3. write to a spreadsheet
